# Personalizing Graph Neural Networks for Session based Recommendation
The code and dataset for our paper: Personalizing Graph Neural Networks with Attention Mechanism for Session-based Recommendation (https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.08887). We have implemented our methods in Tensorflow.

Here are two datasets we used in our paper.

* Xing 
* Reddit

# Usage 

You need to run the file ```/record.py``` first to preprocess the data.

For example: ```python reddit.py --dataset=reddit```

# Requirement
* Python3.6
* Tensorflow1.10
